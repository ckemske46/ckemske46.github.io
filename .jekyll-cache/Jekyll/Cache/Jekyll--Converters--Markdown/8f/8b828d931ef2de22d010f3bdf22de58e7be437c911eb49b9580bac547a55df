<h3 id="blockchain-technologys-applications">Blockchain Technology’s Applications</h3>

<p>The emerging technology of blockchain has grown in popularity and importance in the last several years. Blockchain technology is, in essence, an innovative database solution with varied real-world applications. A blockchain’s main purpose is to provide trustless and transparent database infrastructure that cannot be hacked due to its distributed properties. Blockchain’s key value proposition is to eliminate the counterparty risk associated with using intermediaries in different types of transactions between two willing parties.</p>

<p>Blockchain use-cases are quite abundant and can be seen as improving the old ways of doing business. It facilitates a new decentralized finance concept, called “DeFi” in which market participants can lend, borrow, stake, or earn yield on their digital assets. NFTs or “non-fungible tokens’” have allowed the creator economy to find new ways of monetizing their content and realize all the value associated with their work. Blockchain and digital assets have an application in the global remittance market allowing people to send money back to their families in other countries, effectively at a near-zero cost and settled almost instantaneously.</p>

<p>However, there is one innovation in this space that I want to discuss more prominently. The creation of “smart contracts.” According to Investopedia, smart contracts are</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Smart contracts allow for trustless contracts, operated by the coding housed within a blockchain. They facilitate a transaction between a willing buyer and seller, and once the code is written, it is distributed through the blockchain. Therefore, it cannot be tampered with or changed (unless agreed upon by the community governing the blockchain – but we will get to that in a minute.) These smart contracts, in my opinion, are what give the associated blockchain its value. No longer must users interact with high fee, non-transparent, highly-bureaucratic intermediaries. These users can simply use a blockchain to facilitate their transactions without needing to know the other party involved. The smart contract will make sure the transaction is executed appropriately and fairly.</p>

<p>Now, besides the trustless facilitation of financial transactions, what else can a smart contract do? Smart contracts have created the ability to formulate an internet-native community governed solely by its own members. This is called a DAO or a decentralized autonomous organization.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-dao">What is a DAO?</h3>

<p>The Ethereum Foundation, which governs the Ethereum blockchain stated that a DAO is an:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“internet-native business that’s collectively owned and managed by its members. They have built-in treasuries that no single entity has the authority to access without the approval of the group. Decisions are governed by proposals and voting to ensure everyone in the organization has a voice.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>DAOs, effectively, are purely digital treasuries that serve a specific purpose for those community members and are governed by the code that was used to construct it, – hence the need for smart contracts. These internet-based organizations can only be controlled by those in the community, usually through a governance mechanism. These community members approve or propose new ways the DAO is to operate. Typically, DAO’s offer membership by selling a token associated with the governance of the DAO to market participants who wish to aid and use the platform’s functions.</p>

<p>Let me put this application of smart contracts into perspective. First, we had “Web 1”. During this time of the internet’s maturity, users could view digital content, curated by various entities in a “read-only” medium. “Web 2” came around when users of the internet could now begin to create their own content and interact with others across the globe. Social media is a large aspect of the emergence of “Web 2.” “Web 2” also came with the centralization of power in internet corporations such as Facebook and Google. So, where do DAOs fit in? Blockchain is driving the third iteration of the internet - amply named Web 3 - where we have now created a decentralized governance model for the internet, allowing the internet to effectively govern itself. Smart contracts are created to obey the instructions of the code, allowing these emerging internet-native communities to build new business models and use-cases, all in a trustless and distributed manner. DAOs will play an integral role in facilitating the applications of a decentralized internet.</p>

<h3 id="example-of-daos">Example of DAOs</h3>

<p>These three examples of what a DAO could look like are some of the unique ways I see this model being used. As time progresses, we will see DAOs being used in ways we haven’t thought of yet. This is why DAOs will be so powerful for this new digital global economy we see growing in prominence year after year.</p>

<p><strong>Local Community Treasury:</strong> DAOs offer the infrastructure for users, such as local citizens, to pool their existing capital together and vote on ways that the money can be used to support their community’s well-being. Every community is different and requires different needs to be fulfilled. The DAO would provide a solution where the people who know best could create funding for repairs of roads, creation of local food production, beautification of area, and other crucial areas of interest for their community. As we progress as a society, decentralization and localization will become paramount in dealing with various local community-related problems head on and DAOs inherent functionality can provide a solution.</p>

<p><strong>Shared Investment Vehicle:</strong> The characteristic of a shared internet treasury can be applied to investments and allow those who have not been able to participate in traditional finance, a way of becoming exposed to various financial markets. Anyone with an internet connection can participate in DAO activity as many of the “on-ramps” for various blockchains are simply downloaded from the internet onto your computer and/or smartphone. These “on-ramps” come in the form of digital asset wallets that allow you to interface with a blockchain’s ecosystem. Let’s say a prominent and highly respected financial YouTuber wants to build a way for her community members to share in her wealth and knowledge. She pools together developers and creates a DAO which her community members can invest in. Through the governance model outlined in the smart contract, the newly established investment community can propose and approve of investments that will benefit everyone in the DAO ecosystem. The DAO will not be constricted by geographical borders and can have immense reach to any willing participant. Now, I am no investment advisor or lawyer, and regulations may be a factor in this becoming true. However, I see the digital asset and blockchain space growing in maturity and recognizing its true potential in years to come. One day we will see the barriers to financial markets stripped down and curated to allow for open participation from all around the globe.</p>

<p><strong>Disaster Relief Fund:</strong> With increases in climate change and shifting of weather patterns, regions all over the globe are becoming more susceptible to devastating climate events. Loss of agricultural production, tsunamis, hurricanes, and loss of biodiversity are just to name a few that can have negative impacts on already fragile global communities. After these communities have been affected by these deadly climate events, monetary relief is needed to improve the communities well-being. The smart contract characteristics of a DAO would ensure the trustless delivery of these funds to community leaders that can begin to rebuild what they have lost. We saw during the initial stages of the 2022 Ukraine-Russian War, digital assets were used to aid the Ukrainian people quickly and efficiently. Without the need for intermediaries, the risk of stolen or misplaced funds is negated and all value can be given to those in which the funds were raised.</p>

<h3 id="why-we-need-the-dao-model-to-succeed">Why we need the DAO model to succeed</h3>

<p>DAOs are going to change the way we view and engage with businesses and communities. The World Economic Forum states,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“DAOs offer the promise of enabling a focus on community, rather than just profit, and might offer a more socially-conscious structure.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The DAO innovation will strip away the hierarchical and bureaucratic structures that have defined society for decades and give power back to the ordinary person by allowing them to participate in communities that serve their needs in a decentralized manner. From DAOs offering new ways for people to invest all the way to pooling donations quickly for humanitarian efforts, the use-cases are just becoming established and with time, we will realize the value they will bring into our world.</p>
